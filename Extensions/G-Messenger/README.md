### FAQ
#### How do I get people to show up in the extension?
Go to your friends list (in-game) and open the profile of the friend you want to message, it will then
appear in the extension.

#### Why is the taskbar icon flashing?
This means you have unread messages.

#### Can I close/relaunch the extension while Habbo is connected?
No, because the extension needs a copy of your name and friends list for it to work.
